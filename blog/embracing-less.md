In last few months I was in need of a perfect blogging system that can help me in getting myself out to the world. After looking at Gatsby, jekyll, Medium and Wordpress. I choose to embrace the power of less and dont't get in the design when content is the epicceter.

 I previously used medium.com but It wasn't something I liked. Getting aa nicer versions control and writing in markdown was what I really needed. I don't want to get adsense oro any kind of nicer design stuff.

## Why not medium, Wordpress
- No markdown,
- don't have a git like version control

## Current Setup
Just a git repo (good'ol github page) with a blog folder containing a bunch of markdown files no unnecessary setup needed no html, no styling, just default github like markdown styling.

## What's so good about it

- [Less mass](https://signalvnoise.com/archives2/getting_real_less_mass.php)
- No build system, no styling
- I just need to focus on the content
- version control
