# Embracing Less

> You probably aren't gonna to need a blogging system

[Why Blogging](https://dev.to/aspittel/blogging-as-a-developer--5h0m)

In last few months I was in need of a perfect blogging system that can help me in getting myself out to the world. After looking at Gatsby, jekyll, Medium and Wordpress. I choose to embrace the power of less and don't get in the design when content is the epic-center.

I previously used [Medium.com](http://medium.com) but It wasn't something I liked. Getting a nicer versions control and writing in markdown was what I really needed. I don't want to get ad-sense or any kind of nicer design stuff.

## Why not medium, Wordpress
- No markdown,
- don't have a git like version control

As all the community is leaving medium because of there money-making policy isn't for us [DHH talks about it in some detail](https://medium.com/signal-v-noise/signal-v-noise-exits-medium-56c483d827fc). I have wrote many posts on medium and got lot of views. but I want to move on. I wanted a small [personal space on the internet](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/why-my-new-blog-isnt-on-medium-3b280282fbae)

## Current Setup
Just a git repo (good'ol github page) with a blog folder containing a bunch of markdown files no unnecessary setup needed no html, no styling, just default github like markdown styling.

### What's so good about it

- [Less mass](https://signalvnoise.com/archives2/getting_real_less_mass.php)
- No config, No build system, No styling
- I just need to focus on the content
- Version Control
- Open Source :smile:
